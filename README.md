hi

basically playing around opencv, using my previous model [here](https://github.com/allelbhagya/emotion-detection), this one takes that emotion and shows an emoji in a thought bubble.

want to try out?

1. clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/allelbhagya/emoji
   ```

2. run main.ipynb

3. smile and let me know how it's working :)
